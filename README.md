# Project_H1-B_Visa_DataAnalyse-Prediction
Data analyst challenge: H1-B Visa Petitions H1B visa data analyse and prediction use ML.
H1B visa is a temporary work visa in the USA for people with special skills. To obtain this visa, the applicant needs a job offer from a US employer, who files an H1B visa petition with the USCIS, including attestations about wages and working conditions. Once the petition is approved, the employee can obtain a visa stamp and work for the employer in the USA.

In my prespective,I list the following objectives and tasks.

Objectives:
Aggregate and wrangle data from US government on H1-B visa applications from 2014 to 2016.
Perform data analysis to identify trends and insights
Clean and preprocess data for modeling
Develop and train models to predict visa petition outcomes
Evaluate and compare model performance
Summarize findings and provide recommendations
Tasks:
Collect and download H1-B visa application data from US government websites
Load data into a Jupyter notebook or other data analysis tool
Explore and visualize the data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies
Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues
Engineer new features and variables to improve modeling performance
Develop and train classification models to predict visa petition outcomes
Evaluate and compare model performance using appropriate metrics and techniques
Summarize findings and provide recommendations for employers and applicants seeking H1-B visas.
